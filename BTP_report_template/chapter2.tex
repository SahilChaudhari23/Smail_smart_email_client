\section{Conclusion}

This chapter provided details of the some of the existing
distributed algorithms for constructing a CDS in wireless ad-hoc
networks. The results of these evaluations are summarized in table
\ref{table1}. In next chapter, we discuss our distributed
Algorithm I, for constructing a small backbone in ad-hoc wireless
network.
